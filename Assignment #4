         <p>Once upon a time there was a Frog named Frog. 
            He lived in his lillipad castle on top of the greatest pond in the land. 
            Frog was royalty in their community but they never felt as such. 
            Frog never felt in place with the rest of their family. 
            One day Frog was hopping through the castle and came upon a group of servant mice. 
            Frog was always told to stay away from the servants but this one day in particular, Frog did something no one of the royal family could imagine.</p>
         <p>Frog began to approach the mice servants. 
            They said "Hello there, thank you for taking care of our castle". 
            The mice were exstatic - leaping in joy. 
            There was one smaller mouse behing the rest of the mice that did not seem as excited for this feedback from Frog.
            Frog then approached the small mouse and asked what was wrong. 
            Mouse said "I am just tired of taking care of the castle while my family barely has food to set on the table". 
            Frog was so disappointed to hear this. Frog grabbed Mouse's hand and leaped away.</p>
         <p>As Frog and Mouse leaped through the castle, Mouse questioned where they were going. 
            Frog said, "You will see soon enough".
            When they approached the grand doors Frog told Mouse to close their eyes. 
            Frog opened the heavy doors to a room full of savory foods and sweet treats. 
            "I have never seen something so delightful", Mouse exclaimed. 
            "Take whatever you'd like", Frog announced. 
            Mouse began to cover their face in all of the food they could get their hands on.
            "I am grateful for you my Lord", Mouse thanked. 
            "Call me your friend", Frog corrected with a smile.</p>

         <p>Frog told Mouse that they were always welcome in their castle. 
            Mouse had never experienced such kindness. 
            The next day Mouse returned to their job with their family. Frog interrupted the mice family stroll through the castle and took Mouse back to the same room to feast.
            They ate and laughed together all day until Mouse had to go back home. 
            The following weeks, Frog and Mouse continued this ritual everyday until it became traditon.</p>
            <p>The entirety of their time together, the mice family believed Mouse to be off cleaning a secret portion of the castle. 
               Frog's royal family believed they were off studying to be the next royal heir. 
               One day, Frog's royal family had a dinner set up to help Frog practice their heiress skills. 
               When Frog and Mouse opened the doors, Frogs's family jumped up in disbelief. 
               "What are you doing with that... that thing", the royal family yelled. 
               "Mouse is my friend and you can choose to accept it or no longer accept me", Frog answered.
               Mouse could not believe their new found friend would stand up to their family. 
               Frog and Mouse left the room and went about their day. 
               As the days continued, the royal family never bothered Frog about their friendship with Mouse ever again. 
               Mouse's family found out about the friendship and accepted their decision as well. 
               In the end, Frog and Mouse continued their tradition everytime Mouse came to visit the castle, even some days when Mouse did not work in the castle. 
               Frog and Mouse lived happily ever after.</p>
